# LASReader
Log ASCII Standart file reader

LAS or Log ASCII Standart was introduced in 1990 by Canadian Well Logging Society (www.cwls.org). It is designed to store borehole related data. Standart documantation can be found on this page: https://www.cwls.org/products/.

Currently there are three versions of LAS: 1.2, 2.0 and 3.0. The LASReader should be able to read most of the 1.2 and 2.0 files that are most common now. Reading in wrapped LAS file is not supported.

Todo list:

- [ ] read data from files with wrapped mode
- [ ] read version 3.0 files
- [ ] add exception handling
